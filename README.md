**Design & Functionality:**

-	Homepage:
-	
The homepage of the website contains the following elements.
.  The navigation pane at the top of the screen. (Home, Courses, Calculate Fees, Contact Us)
. The logo just below the navigation pane.
. The short history of the initiative.
. Buttons that take users to the different courses provided by the initiative, as well as the page where users can calculate their total fee to pay.
. Contact details at the bottom of the screen. (These details will display at the bottom of each page on the website.)
 	
Each button is the same colour as the colours in the logo. These colours are green, yellow, red, and blue.
When hovering over the selections in the navigation pane, the text will appear blue, indicating that it is a link between each page in the website. The background of the logo is a dark shade of grey, to make the entire UI more aesthetically pleasing, and to help the logo pop out more, the background of every page will be a lighter shade of grey than that of the logo.

**-	Courses page:**

This page will vary depending on which button the user clicks on. The information of the course button clicked on by the user will display here.
Details include the course name, a summary of what participants can expect, and the pricing.

**-	Fee calculator page:**

Here, the total fee of the selected courses can be calculated based on which courses were chosen and how many courses were chosen. 
Details that display include the list of courses chosen, the total fee, the discount percentage, and the space where the calculated fee amount will be displayed. Should participants only choose one course, no discount is added. Two courses will gain a discount of 5%. Three courses have a 10% discount, and any number above that has a 15% discount. 


**-	Contact Us page:**

This design and functionality are simple. A space where participants can input their personal details, such as their email address, phone number, name and surname, and their age, will display here.
